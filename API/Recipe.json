      "statement": "I was born in North India into a vegetarian family. My mother is an excellent cook who paid attention to every detail. One of the most important details for me is cooking with fresh ingredients. As a child and young adult, I helped my mother in the kitchen. I learned to cook with just a few spices and herbs in order not to compromise the taste of the vegetables, grains and lentils.After I got married and moved to the United States from India in 2010, my family remained vegetarian. I am passionate about this way of life today. I am here to show you simple and practical recipes that carry out the authenticity of Indian vegetarian cooking.",
